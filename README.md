### Deploy & Demo
I have deployed this coding task in my github pages, you can check using below link.

[Demo URL](https://jobemichael.github.io/)

Also, you can find the build folder in this repository and you can run using any static server.

```
yarn global add serve

serve -s build

```

## Detail
- used redux in this app but without redux also we can solve this. Since it mentioned in the task `usage of state container`, I have used it.
- For mocking, I am using mockapi.io
- this app will look perfect even in small devices.
- tests are included with good coverage.
